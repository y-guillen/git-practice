Joan had a little lion
Little lion, little lion
Joan had a little lion
Its fleece was white as snow
And everywhere that Joan went
Joan went, Joan went
Everywhere that Joan went
The lion was sure to go

He followed her to school one day
School one day, school one day
He followed her to school one day
Which was against the rule
It made the children laugh and play
Laugh and play, laugh and play
It made the children laugh and play
To see a lion at school

And so the teacher turned him out
Turned him out, turned him out
And so the teacher turned him out
But still he lingered near
And waited patiently
Patiently, patiently
And wai-aited patiently
Til Joan did appear

Joan had a little lion
Little lion, little lion
Joan had a little lion
Its fleece was white as snow
And everywhere that Joan went
Joan went, Joan went
Everywhere that Joan went
The lion was sure to go
